### TASK 1

　　There are many ways to learn about people of other lands.
One way is to study the clothing other people wear.

　　For thousands of years, people in different parts of the world have worn very different types of clothing.
There are four big reasons for this.

　　One reason might be religion.
In many Moslem countries, women must wear veils to hide their faces.
The veils must be worn in public.
Veils are part of the Moslem religion.

This is another reason why people dress differently.
Western countries rely on machines to make most of their clothing.
Someone living in India can use only hand power to make the clothing he needs.

　　World-wide differences in customs also lead to differences in clothing.
A Mexican farmer wears a straw hat with a brim(帽檐) up.
In China, a farmer wears a straw hat with a brim down. Both hats are used to protect the farmers from the sun.
Some of these customs have come down through thousands of years.

### TASK 7

　　For three or four thousand years a family of marmots（旱獭）had been settled in a grassy little valley under the cliffs（悬崖）of a peak whose present name is the Rock of Wonders.

　　The spot was a remarkably suitable one for all sorts of good reasons.
In the first place, the slope（坡）faced south. The sun shone on it from dawn until dark, and in the spring the snow melted there faster than anywhere else.
One could warm oneself as much as one wished, or again one could sit in the shade of huge rocks fallen from the heights of the mountain.
A little way off a tiny spring fed a little lake.
Thanks to this fresh spring, which never dried up, the grasses round about grew thick and strong, even in the mouth of August.

　　The rocks provided many sitting places and perfectly safe holes where one could take refuge in an emergency.
As for the Family Cave, founded many years ago by the grandfather of the present inhabitant（居民）,it opened out pleasantly to the plain.
Since it had already been improved by two generations, it would have been difficult to find a drier and more comfortable apartment.

   * B. They could not climb down the cliffs.

   * A. The warm sun  
   * B. The high peak  
   * C. The spring

   * A. The summer days were warmer.      
   * B. The best view was to the south
   * C. Marmots need a lot of sun.    

4. From the story we know that marmots like to live in a home that is <HideText text="C" />.

   * A. warm         
   * B. light          
   * C. dry

TASK 8:
Dear Sirs,
    I'm writing to tell you that your latest shipment (装运) of apples is not up to the standard we expected from you. Many of them are bruised (擦伤), and more than half are covered with little spots. They are classed as Grade A, but I think there must have been some mistake, as they are definitely not Grade A apples.
    We have always been satisfied with the quality of your produce (农产品), which makes this case all the more puzzling. I would be grateful if you could look into the matter. We would be happy to keep the apples and try to sell them at a reduced price, but in that case we would obviously need a credit (部分退款) from you. Alternatively, you could collect them and replace them with apples of the right quality. Would you please phone me to let me know how you want to handle it?
Yours faithfully
Fiona Stockton
Purchasing Manager

TASK 9:
“Peanuts” creator Charles Schulz was remembered as a genius who touched the lives of millions of Americans.
The 77-year-old cartoonist died in his sleep on February 12 at his California home.
Life won’t be the same without Charles Schulz. His lifetime of work has linked generations of Americans and has become a part of the fabric of American culture. The Americans let “Peanuts” into their lives on a daily basis.
For 50 years, “Peanuts” has tickled（使满足）American’s funny bone. But more than that, Charles Schulz’s characters mirrored people’s lives and taught them timeless lessons about faith, hope, and love. Americans never forget Snoopy’s imagination, Linus’ innocence, Woodstock’s loyalty or Charlie Brown’s vulnerabilities, hopes and dreams.
Charles Schulz died at the age of      6      .
He worked for a lifetime as      7      .
His work has become a part of the structure of     8      .
His cartoons taught people something about     9      .
We can infer from the passage that Snoopy, Linus, Woodstock and Charlie Brown are Charles Schulz’s      10      .

TASK 10:
Normally, at the beginning of the school year, the Student Services of universities and colleges publish lists of rooms and apartments available off campus. You should pay attention to these services as well as advertisements in the local or college universities newspapers, and bulletin boards(告示板)on the campus or in supermarkets. You might also walk through the section of the city or to town in which you wish to live, to see whether there are “FOR RENT” signs on the doors or windows of houses. You may also ask other students for advice, either Canadian or from overseas. It would be wise to set aside at least several full days to look for accommodation(住宿)at the beginning of your program. This will allow you to obtain an idea of the range of housing available. Usually, it is not a good idea to take the first accommodation that you see unless, of course, you are certain that it will be satisfactory.
Accommodation outside the center of a city is normally less expensive than accommodation in the center of the city.
Finding Accommodation for Foreign Students
You can obtain information from 
1.   6  of your university or college;
2.   7   in some newspapers; or 
3.   8   on the campus, etc.
You are recommended
1. to set aside    9   to search for accommodation;
2. not to take the first accommodation unless it is    10  .
答案：6. the students service    7. advertisements     8. bulletin boards 
9. several full days    10. satisfactory
