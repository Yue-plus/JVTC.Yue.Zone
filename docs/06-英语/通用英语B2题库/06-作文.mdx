<BorderCard>
  <p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>
  <p>
    &emsp;&emsp;I saw your advertisement in today’s newspaper and I am writing
    to apply for the position of a qualified waiter. I have been interested in
    the restaurant business since I was a young boy. My mother is a manager of a
    restaurant in our town and has taught me a lot about serving food and drinks
    and cleaning tables.
  </p>
  <p>
    &emsp;&emsp;As you can see from the enclosed CV, I have a good school
    leaving certificate. I also have a good command of English, both spoken and
    written. I achieved very good marks in cooking.
  </p>
  <p>
    &emsp;&emsp;I spent my last two summer holidays working in a local snack
    bar, which I enjoyed very much.
  </p>
  <p>
    &emsp;&emsp;I would appreciate the chance to come for an interview and am
    available at any time.
  </p>
  <p>&emsp;&emsp;I look forward to your reply.</p>
