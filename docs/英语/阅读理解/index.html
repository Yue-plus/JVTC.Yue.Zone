One way is to study the clothing other people wear.</p><p>　　For thousands of years, people in different parts of the world have worn very different types of clothing.
There are four big reasons for this.</p><p>　　One reason might be religion.
In many Moslem countries, women must wear veils to hide their faces.
The veils must be worn in public.
Veils are part of the Moslem religion.</p><p>　　The second reason is that different materials are used in different countries.
For instance, in France the materials used in clothing may be cotton, silk, wool, or many other man-made materials.
Most people in China wear cotton.</p><p>　　The ways clothes are made are also very different.
This is another reason why people dress differently.
Western countries rely on machines to make most of their clothing.
Someone living in India can use only hand power to make the clothing he needs.</p><p>　　World-wide differences in customs also lead to differences in clothing.
A Mexican farmer wears a straw hat with a brim(帽檐) up.
In China, a farmer wears a straw hat with a brim down. Both hats are used to protect the farmers from the sun.
Some of these customs have come down through thousands of years.</p><ol><li><p>If you want to learn about the differences about people in the world, you <span style="color:black;background-color:black;padding:0 8px">C</span>.</p><ul><li>A. should know the ways to study other lands</li><li>B. should know the four big reasons given in the passage</li><li>C. may study the different types of clothing people wear</li></ul></li><li><p>In many Moslem countries, women have to <span style="color:black;background-color:black;padding:0 8px">B</span> in public.</p><ul><li>A. wear more clothes than men</li><li>B. cover their faces with veils</li><li>C. protect their faces from being hurt  </li></ul></li><li><p>Which of the following is the reason for the differences in clothing? <span style="color:black;background-color:black;padding:0 8px">A</span></p><ul><li>A.

He looked thin and hungry but his blue eyes were determined.
He was hoping to get work in show business for he could sing and dance.</p><p>　　His parents were music hall artists and he had been born into the life of the stage.
And, although his own boyhood was painfully hard, he knew how to make people laugh.
His own father had died from drinking too much.
And his mother wasn’t really able to look after Charles and his elder half-brother, Sid, because she was often sick in mind and had to be sent into hospital.
Even when she was home with them, she seemed to live in a different world. Her illness made the boys very sad.</p><p>　　As young men, he and his brother travelled to America in a small company of actors and acted in various cities.
One day Charles was invited to join a new company that was making film comedies.
He accepted the offer and soon became popular.</p><p>　　By the time he was thirty, Charles was the greatest, best known, and best loved comedian in the world.
He had formed his own film-making company and was writing and producing his own films.
He was welcomed by excited crowds who surrounded him wherever he went.
But he worked very hard and had few close friends.</p><ol><li><p>Charles Chaplin lived in <span style="color:black;background-color:black;padding:0 8px">B</span> when he was a boy.</p><ul><li>A.

So he thought the land must be rich in gold. He named the place Costa Rica, which means “rich coast” in Spanish.</p><p>　　Though little gold was found, Costa Rica today is indeed rich with coffee and bananas.
Coffee is the most important product in Costa Rica and most of it is exported (出口) to other countries like America and West Germany.
Bananas are the country’s second most important export.</p><p>　　Costa Ricans also grow many other crops such as fruits, corn and beans for their own use.
Costa Ricans love colors and their houses are painted in bright colors. </p><p>　　Education is very important to the Costa Ricans.
Almost every village has a school and education is a must for children between seven and fourteen years of age.
Boys and girls go to separate (单独的) schools.
Classes begin in March and end in November.

He counts the money again.
No doubt about it----there is a mistake.
There is too much.
Five pounds too much.
He puts his money carefully in his pocket and says nothing to the others.
A week goes by.
It’s payday again.

This time there isn’t enough money in his envelope.
It is five pounds short. He goes immediately to see the boss.
He is very angry.</p><p>　　“Look,” he says, “there isn’t enough money in my pay envelope.” “That’s right,” says the boss.

Dear Sirs,
I&#x27;m writing to tell you that your latest shipment (装运) of apples is not up to the standard we expected from you. Many of them are bruised (擦伤), and more than half are covered with little spots. They are classed as Grade A, but I think there must have been some mistake, as they are definitely not Grade A apples.
We have always been satisfied with the quality of your produce (农产品), which makes this case all the more puzzling. I would be grateful if you could look into the matter. We would be happy to keep the apples and try to sell them at a reduced price, but in that case we would obviously need a credit (部分退款) from you. Alternatively, you could collect them and replace them with apples of the right quality. Would you please phone me to let me know how you want to handle it?
Yours faithfully
Fiona Stockton
Purchasing Manager

“Peanuts” creator Charles Schulz was remembered as a genius who touched the lives of millions of Americans.
The 77-year-old cartoonist died in his sleep on February 12 at his California home.
Life won’t be the same without Charles Schulz. His lifetime of work has linked generations of Americans and has become a part of the fabric of American culture. The Americans let “Peanuts” into their lives on a daily basis.
For 50 years, “Peanuts” has tickled（使满足）American’s funny bone. But more than that, Charles Schulz’s characters mirrored people’s lives and taught them timeless lessons about faith, hope, and love. Americans never forget Snoopy’s imagination, Linus’ innocence, Woodstock’s loyalty or Charlie Brown’s vulnerabilities, hopes and dreams.
Charles Schulz died at the age of      6      .
He worked for a lifetime as      7      .
His work has become a part of the structure of     8      .

Normally, at the beginning of the school year, the Student Services of universities and colleges publish lists of rooms and apartments available off campus. You should pay attention to these services as well as advertisements in the local or college universities newspapers, and bulletin boards(告示板)on the campus or in supermarkets. You might also walk through the section of the city or to town in which you wish to live, to see whether there are “FOR RENT” signs on the doors or windows of houses. You may also ask other students for advice, either Canadian or from overseas. It would be wise to set aside at least several full days to look for accommodation(住宿)at the beginning of your program. This will allow you to obtain an idea of the range of housing available. Usually, it is not a good idea to take the first accommodation that you see unless, of course, you are certain that it will be satisfactory.
Accommodation outside the center of a city is normally less expensive than accommodation in the center of the city.
