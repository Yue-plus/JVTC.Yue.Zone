Passport and visa are the most important documents for traveling abroad. They let me enter the country and help me in case of trouble. I keep them safe and handy.

Camera and charger help me capture and share the moments of my travel. I love taking photos of the places, people, and things I see. They are like souvenirs that last forever. I bring them with me.

Some local currency is the money I need to pay for things in the country. Having some cash is convenient and useful. Sometimes, cash is the only way to pay. It also helps me avoid fees or bad rates. I exchange some money before I go.

These are the three things I pack for the travel to foreign countries. They make my trip more enjoyable and memorable.

Internship is a way for college students to gain practical skills and knowledge in a field or industry. Some students may find internship helpful and enjoyable, while others may not. Internship has some advantages and disadvantages that students should consider before deciding.

## Title: Job Hunting

:::info
Topic: Have you ever had a job interview? Sharing your ideas about the most impressive job interview you had and talking about what the most important thing is during a job Hunting?
:::

I have never had a job interview myself, but I can imagine it can be a stressful and exciting experience. I think the most important thing during a job hunting is to be confident and prepared. Confidence can help you show your strengths and personality to the potential employer, and preparation can help you research the company, the role and the common questions that might be asked.

One of the most impressive job interviews I have heard of was from a friend of mine who applied for a software engineer position at a tech company. He had to solve several coding challenges on a whiteboard in front of a panel of interviewers, and then he had to explain his solutions and answer some technical questions. He said he was nervous at first, but he managed to impress them with his skills and knowledge. He got the job offer the next day.
